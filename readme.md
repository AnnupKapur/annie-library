# TASK 1

Your mission, should you choose to accept it ...
Start the library system.

## Part 1

Think about how the library can store
information about all the books.

The library needs to know:

1. the book's ISBN number (e.g. 123-456-789)
2. the book's name (e.g. Dorian Gray)
3. the quantity they have (e.g 100000000000000... 🤷)

See if you can create this.
Add a few books to start with.

I have added an empty python file called **'library.py'**
for you to start writing code.

## Part 2 (_this is next week's task_)

The library gets a delivery of new books,
how can they add these new books to the catalogue?

Write a function which allows the library to
add these new books to their catalogue.

### NOTES & HINTS

At this stage, do not worry about the while loop
and menus and other things.
Focus solely on how you can store the books.
Then try and write a function to add to the books.
I am purposely not telling you how to store the books.
I want you to think about the best way of doing it.
